DotNetSamples
=============

A collection of very very very basic .NET and C# samples. You can browse and see various usage of 

Yesterday I uploaded on GitHub a lot of .NET and C# samples I have created over the years, as part of my presentations and trainings. You can find them here and download them. Feel free to reuse the code! All the samples are comprises of  very little code that does a specific thing. Some of the samples are pretty old and have been superceded by new language/framework advancements (e.g. Linq To XML vs XmlReader) but I’ve decided to keep them in case they prove useful to someone.
